## Attribution for Data And Software: Provencance

The platform itself contain very limited (if any) additions to scientific data analysis workflows. 
In all cases, these workflows are provided by the experts, and our role is to facilitate the contributions, and make access to the live workflows as well as the workflow results easiers for the users.

Hence, it is vital to recognize that ODA services are not themselves providing the data. We attach **Data and Software Provenance**  to the produced results in order to clearly recognize the collective effort, supported by a varienty of institutions and individuals.

## Right To Replicate

Since we provide **Software as a Service**, users may be in danger of locking-in the platform and depending on our continious support. While this situation could benefitial for us (and is indeed major part of business model of some top services), we consider this kind of behavior immoral, and make effort to allow full deployment of the platform in alternative locations. 

In principle, it should be always possible to move the platform elsewhere, respecting the [right to replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/)

We provide full open software and data, and following the best we can good design practices for cloud-based deployment. 
But we can not make unreasonable effort to assist every alternative deployment.

We can not be responsible for any damage caused by the unsafe deployments (as described in detail in the licences).
